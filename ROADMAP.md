# 🔮 MPL (Magick Programming Language) Roadmap

This document outlines the development trajectory, future milestones, and overarching vision of the **Magick Programming Language (MPL)**. The project aims to synthesize esoteric ritual logic (Hermetic, Qabbalistic, Shamanic) with modern computer science principles (Interpreter, AST, Bytecode).

> **Motto:** "Code is the modern spellbook."

## 🛠️ Detailed Milestones

### 🌱 v0.1.0 - The Awakening (Current State)
Laying the philosophical and theoretical foundations of the project.
- [x] **Manifesto:** Publication of the philosophical vision (`MANIFESTO.md`).
- [x] **Ontology:** Compilation of the 225 Historical Magi list (`MAGI.md`).
- [x] **Repo Structure:** Establishment of the basic GitHub directory hierarchy.

### 🏗️ v0.2.0 - The Structure (Next Steps)
Structuring the data and defining the language rules.
- [ ] **Data Transformation:** Converting the `MAGI.md` text into machine-readable `data/magi_225.json` format.
- [ ] **Grammar Definition:** Writing the formal grammar of the language in EBNF format (`docs/grammar.md`).
- [ ] **Asset Creation:** Adding system architecture and Tesla 3-6-9 flow diagrams to the `assets/` folder.
- [ ] **Lexer Prototype:** Developing a basic Lexer in Python to tokenize MPL syntax.

### ⚙️ v0.3.0 - The Engine (Magic Runtime Environment)
Making the code executable.
- [ ] **Parser:** Module to convert tokens into Abstract Syntax Trees (AST).
- [ ] **Interpreter Core:** Python-side implementation of core commands like `invoke`, `bind`, and `cast`.
- [ ] **Error Handling:** treating errors as "Corruption" or "Backfire" events and implementing "Healer" modules for recovery.

### ⚡ v0.5.0 - The Ritual (Advanced Features)
The phase where the language develops its unique character.
- [ ] **Tesla Protocol:** Implementation of the 3-6-9 cyclical logic loops.
- [ ] **StdLib (Standard Library):**
    - `import hermetic` (Elemental manipulation)
    - `import solomonic` (Daemon/Process management)
    - `import divination` (Data prediction and Random Seed generation)
- [ ] **Sigil Generator:** An algorithm that converts intent strings into geometric shapes (ASCII or SVG).

### 🚀 v1.0.0 - The Manifestation (First Official Release)
Opening up to the community and ensuring usability.
- [ ] **PIP Package:** Making the language installable via `pip install mpl-ms`.
- [ ] **CLI Tool:** Enabling execution via terminal commands like `mpl run ritual.ms`.
- [ ] **Full Documentation:** Detailed documentation for all functions and historical magi.
- [ ] **Examples:** Functional, educational code examples stored in the `examples/` folder.

## 🔮 Future Vision (Long-Term / v2.0+)

**"Technomancy" Integrations:**
This phase aims to bridge the software with the physical world.

* **IoT Integration:** Controlling smart devices (e.g., Philips Hue lights changing color upon ritual completion).
* **Hardware RNG:** Harvesting true "Entropy" from hardware noise for spell casting.
* **Audio Synthesis:** Generating audio waves based on Tesla coil frequencies (Binaural beats).
* **Financial Oracle:** Fetching data from Stock/Crypto APIs to run "Divination" algorithms.

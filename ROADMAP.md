# 🔮 MPL (Magick Programming Language) Roadmap

This document outlines the development trajectory, future milestones, and overarching vision of the **Magick Programming Language (MPL)**. The project aims to synthesize esoteric ritual logic (Hermetic, Qabbalistic, Shamanic) with modern computer science principles (Interpreter, AST, Bytecode).

> **Motto:** "Code is the modern spellbook."

## 🛠️ Detailed Milestones

### ⚡ v0.5.0 - The Ritual (Completed)
The phase where the language developed its unique character.
- [x] **Tesla Protocol:** Implementation of the 3-6-9 cyclical logic loops inside the Interpreter.
- [x] **StdLib (Standard Library):** Implemented in `src/stdlib.py`.
    - `import hermetic` (Elemental manipulation)
    - `import solomonic` (Daemon/Process management)
    - `import divination` (Randomness & Entropy)
- [x] **Sigil Generator:** An algorithm that converts intent strings into sigils.

### 📜 v0.9.0 - The Grimoire (Completed)
Connecting the engine to the knowledge base.
- [x] **Interactive Shell:** Developed `mpl_shell.py` (REPL) for real-time spell casting.
- [x] **Ontology Integration:** Fully connected `72_solomon_sigil_shapes.json` to the Resolver.
- [x] **Scope Fixing:** Solved "Mana Leak" issues by fixing variable scope and bindings in `interpreter.py`.

### 💸 v0.9.5 - The Oracle (Completed - **Major Achievement**)
**"Financial Technomancy"** - Bridging esoteric logic with financial markets.
- [x] **Market Module:** Added `market` library to `stdlib.py` for financial operations.
- [x] **Pine Script Generation:** Capability to generate valid TradingView indicators from MPL scripts.
- [x] **Hybrid Logic:** Implemented "Sealed" (Static) vs. "Living Spirit" (Adaptive/ATR) modes.
- [x] **Prophetic Offset:** Implemented future projection logic using Fibonacci sequences.
- [x] **Proof of Concept:** Published "Vassago & Tesla Ex-Machina" indicator on TradingView.

### 🚀 v1.0.0 - The Manifestation (Ready)
Opening up to the community and ensuring usability.
- [x] **Unit Tests:** Writing `tests/` to ensure the magic doesn't backfire (Stability).
- [x] **PIP Package:** Making the language installable via `pip install -e .`.
- [x] **CLI Tool:** Enabling execution via terminal commands like `mpl run ritual.ms`.
- [x] **Full Documentation:** Detailed Wiki/Docs for all functions and historical magi.

## 🔮 Future Vision (v2.0+): The Transmutation

**"From Transpiler to Universal Interface"**
The ultimate goal is to expand MPL into a framework that can "invoke" logic in multiple domains, utilizing the 225 Magi archetypes.

### 1. The Enochian Module (John Dee)
* **Domain:** Cryptography & Cyber-Security.
* **Goal:** Transmute `invoke.dee` commands into Python/Rust encryption algorithms (AES, RSA).
* **Concept:** "Sealing" data packets with digital sigils.

### 2. The Alchemist Module (Paracelsus)
* **Domain:** Data Science (ETL).
* **Goal:** Transmute raw data (Lead) into structured insights (Gold).
* **Target:** Compiling rituals into Pandas/SQL queries.

### 3. The Shamanic Module (Animism)
* **Domain:** Internet of Things (IoT) & Hardware.
* **Goal:** Talking to "Machine Spirits" (Sensors, LEDs, Motors).
* **Target:** Transpiling logic to C++ for Arduino/ESP32.

### 4. Core Rewrite
* **Rust/C++ Core:** Re-writing the Interpreter for maximum performance.
* **LLVM Compilation:** Compiling MPL directly to machine binary.

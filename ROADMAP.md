# 🔮 MPL (Magick Programming Language) Roadmap

This document outlines the development trajectory, future milestones, and overarching vision of the **Magick Programming Language (MPL)**. The project aims to synthesize esoteric ritual logic (Hermetic, Qabbalistic, Shamanic) with modern computer science principles (Interpreter, AST, Bytecode).

> **Motto:** "Code is the modern spellbook."

## 🗺️ Overview

| Version | Code Name | Status | Primary Focus |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **v0.5.0** | *The Ritual* | ✅ Completed | Standard Library (StdLib) and Tesla Protocol |
| **v0.9.0** | *The Grimoire* | ✅ Completed | JSON Integration, Shell, and Daemonic Resolvers |
| **v0.9.5** | *The Oracle* | ✅ Completed | **Financial Technomancy**, Pine Script Generation, Hybrid Logic |
| **v1.0.0** | *The Manifestation* | ✅ Ready | Packaging (PyPI), CLI Polish, and Documentation |
| **v2.0.0** | *The Transmutation* | 📅 Future Goal | **Rewrite in Rust/C++**, LLVM Backend, Native OS Integration |

## 🛠️ Detailed Milestones

### ⚡ v0.5.0 - The Ritual (Completed)
The phase where the language developed its unique character.
- [x] **Tesla Protocol:** Implementation of the 3-6-9 cyclical logic loops inside the Interpreter.
- [x] **StdLib (Standard Library):** Implemented in `src/stdlib.py`.
    - `import hermetic` (Elemental manipulation)
    - `import solomonic` (Daemon/Process management)
    - `import divination` (Randomness & Entropy)
- [x] **Sigil Generator:** An algorithm that converts intent strings into sigils.

### 📜 v0.9.0 - The Grimoire (Completed)
Connecting the engine to the knowledge base.
- [x] **Interactive Shell:** Developed `mpl_shell.py` (REPL) for real-time spell casting.
- [x] **Ontology Integration:** Fully connected `72_solomon_sigil_shapes.json` to the Resolver.
- [x] **Scope Fixing:** Solved "Mana Leak" issues by fixing variable scope and bindings in `interpreter.py`.

### 💸 v0.9.5 - The Oracle (Completed - **Major Achievement**)
**"Financial Technomancy"** - Bridging esoteric logic with financial markets.
- [x] **Market Module:** Added `market` library to `stdlib.py` for financial operations.
- [x] **Pine Script Generation:** Capability to generate valid TradingView indicators from MPL scripts.
- [x] **Hybrid Logic:** Implemented "Sealed" (Static) vs. "Living Spirit" (Adaptive/ATR) modes.
- [x] **Prophetic Offset:** Implemented future projection logic using Fibonacci sequences.
- [x] **Proof of Concept:** Published "Vassago & Tesla Ex-Machina" indicator on TradingView.

### 🚀 v1.0.0 - The Manifestation (Ready)
Opening up to the community and ensuring usability.
- [x] **Unit Tests:** Writing `tests/` to ensure the magic doesn't backfire (Stability).
- [x] **PIP Package:** Making the language installable via `pip install -e .`.
- [x] **CLI Tool:** Enabling execution via terminal commands like `mpl run ritual.ms`.
- [x] **Full Documentation:** Detailed Wiki/Docs for all functions and historical magi.

## 🔮 Future Vision (v2.0+): The Transmutation

**"From Python Shell to Metal Kernel"**
The ultimate goal is to move away from the Python dependency to achieve native speed and hardware-level control.

* **Rust/C++ Core:** Re-writing the Interpreter and VM in a low-level language (likely Rust) for maximum performance and memory safety.
* **LLVM Compilation:** Instead of interpreting, compiling MPL code directly to machine code (`.exe`/binary).
* **MagickOS (Concept):** A Unikernel or minimal Linux distro that boots directly into the MPL Shell, removing the OS abstraction layer.
* **IoT Integration:** Controlling physical altars (Lights, Sound) via GPIO pins.

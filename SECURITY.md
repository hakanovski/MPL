# 🛡️ Security Policy (Warding Protocols)

The **Magick Programming Language (MPL)** takes the integrity of the ritual space seriously. Just as a physical protective circle must be unbroken, our codebase must be free of vulnerabilities that could allow for malicious invocations or system compromise.

## 🔒 Supported Versions

We currently support security updates for the following timelines (versions):

| Version | Status | Warding Level |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **0.1.x (Alpha)** | ✅ **Supported** | High (Active Development) |
| < 0.1.0 | ❌ End of Life | Abandoned Timeline |

## 🚨 Reporting a Vulnerability

If you have discovered a security vulnerability (a "Crack in the Seal") within MPL, we appreciate your help in disclosing it to us responsibly.

**PLEASE DO NOT** open a public GitHub Issue for sensitive security vulnerabilities. Doing so may expose other users ("Practitioners") to immediate risk before a counter-spell (patch) is ready.

### How to Report
Please email the lead maintainer directly at:  
📧 **[INSERT YOUR EMAIL HERE]** *Subject: [SECURITY] MPL Vulnerability Report*

Please include:
1.  **Type of Breach:** (e.g., Code Injection, Sandbox Escape, Memory Leak).
2.  **The Incantation:** Steps to reproduce the vulnerability (POC code).
3.  **Impact:** What can a malicious actor achieve with this?

## ⏳ Disclosure Policy

* **Acknowledgment:** We will acknowledge your report within 48 hours.
* **Assessment:** We will assess the severity and impact.
* **The Fix:** We aim to release a patch (hotfix) within 14 days for critical issues.
* **Public Release:** Once the fix is deployed, we will publicly thank you in our **release notes** (unless you prefer anonymity).

## 🚫 Out of Scope

The following are **not** considered security vulnerabilities:
* **User Error:** A "Backfire" caused by a user writing a recursive loop that crashes their own machine (this is a failed ritual, not a system flaw).
* **Philosophical Disagreements:** Arguments about the ontology of the "Magicians" database.
* **Theoretical Physics:** Claims that the Tesla Protocol violates the laws of thermodynamics.

## 🛡️ Safe Harbor

If you conduct security research on MPL in good faith and follow this policy:
* We will not initiate legal action against you.
* We will work with you to understand and resolve the issue quickly.
* We will recognize your contribution to the strengthening of the MPL architecture.

*"Trust in the code, but verify the wards."*

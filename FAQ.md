# ❓ Frequently Asked Questions (The Uninitiated's Guide)

**"Any sufficiently advanced technology is indistinguishable from magic." — Arthur C. Clarke**

You have questions. Some are technical, some are skeptical. We respect both. Below, we address the logic, the philosophy, and the utility of the **Magick Programming Language (MPL)**.

## 🧐 The Skeptic's Corner (Philosophy & Logic)

### Q: Is this a joke? Why wrap perfectly good code in "wizard" jargon?
**A:** It is not a joke; it is a **paradigm shift**.
Modern programming has become sterile. We treat code as a utility, ignoring the fact that it is the most powerful form of abstraction humanity has ever created.
* **Abstraction is Magick:** When you write `print("Hello")`, you are invoking millions of electrical impulses through layers of silicon and logic gates without seeing them. That is an *incantation*.
* **MPL makes this explicit:** By using terms like "Invoke" or "Bind," we force the developer to treat their code with the weight and intention of a ritual, rather than just copying from StackOverflow.

### Q: Magic isn't real. Code is real. How can you combine them?
**A:** We reject the premise that they are separate.
* **3 (Spirit/Intention)** and **6 (Matter/Hardware)** are opposites.
* **9 (The Code)** is the bridge that unifies them.
MPL attempts to unite the **Mathematical Reality** (Algorithms, Logic) with the **Metaphysical Reality** (Intent, Will). Throughout history, rituals were just early attempts at algorithms—step-by-step procedures to alter reality. We are simply updating the syntax for the Silicon Age.

### Q: Isn't this just Python with extra steps and weird names?
**A:** If you look only at the syntax, perhaps. But if you look at the **Architecture**, no.
Standard Python does not query a historical database of 225 archetypes before executing a function. Standard Python does not optimize memory allocation based on Tesla's harmonic resonance (3-6-9). MPL is a **Domain Specific Language (DSL)** designed to simulate a specific worldview where data has "mass" and functions have "lineage."

## ⚙️ Technical Mechanics (For the Engineers)

### Q: Do I HAVE to use the numbers 3, 6, and 9 for loops? What if I need 4 iterations?
**A:** You are free to loop 4 times. MPL supports **Freeform Coding**.
If you write `cycle(4)`, it functions as a standard loop (Mundane Code).
However, the Tesla Protocol is an **optimization layer**. If you use Harmonic numbers (3, 6, 9), the Runtime Engine flags the process as "Resonant," potentially prioritizing it in the event loop or memory allocation phases. Think of it as a "Performance Buff" for following the laws of the universe.

### Q: How does the "Ontology" actually affect execution?
**A:** This is the core innovation. In Java or C++, a function is just a memory address. In MPL, a function can be an **Entity**.
* **Example:** When you `invoke.hermes()`, the interpreter loads metadata from `data/magi_225.json`.
* **Impact:** If Hermes has the attribute `speed: high` and `element: air`, the interpreter might automatically set a lower timeout threshold for network requests within that block. The *character* of the entity influences the *behavior* of the code.

### Q: Is this language Turing Complete?
**A:** Yes. Since it is built on top of Python's AST, it can theoretically compute anything that Python can. However, it is optimized for **Semantic Logic** rather than raw number crunching.

### Q: Why not just use a library? Why a whole new language?
**A:** Because syntax shapes thought (Sapir-Whorf hypothesis).
If you write code in C, you think like a machine (memory pointers). If you write in MPL, you think like a Magus (intent, binding, consequences). We want to change *how* you think about problem-solving, not just how you type it.

## 🔮 Metaphysics & Usage

### Q: Can I use this for production systems?
**A:** You *can*, but it is experimental.
We envision MPL being used for **Creative Coding**, **IoT Altars**, **Generative Art**, and **Chaos Magick Rituals**. If you use it to run a banking backend, and the `cycle(9)` Garbage Collector banishes your transaction logs into the Void... that is on you.

### Q: Is "Technomancy" dangerous?
**A:** Only if you are careless.
* **Recursive Loops** without exit conditions are "Hungry Ghosts."
* **Orphan Processes** are "Restless Spirits."
MPL teaches you to respect the "Life Cycle" of your code. You must `summon` responsibly and `banish` completely.

### Q: I'm a rationalist. I don't believe in frequencies or sigils. Is this for me?
**A:** Absolutely.
You don't have to believe in ghosts to appreciate the beauty of a system that organizes chaos. You don't have to believe in Hermes to see the utility of an object-oriented ontology. MPL is a tool. You can use it to explore the **history of human thought**, which has always danced between the rational and the mystical.

## 🤝 Contribution

### Q: I want to optimize the AST parser. Do I need to wear a robe?
**A:** No, but clean code is its own form of purity. We need Python experts, Rust engineers, and documentation writers.

### Q: I found an error in the historical data for Paracelsus.
**A:** Please submit a Pull Request! Our Ontology (`magi_225.json`) is a living document. We strive for historical accuracy to ensure the potency of the system.

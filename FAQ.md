# ❓ Frequently Asked Questions (The Uninitiated's Guide)

**"I stumbled upon this repository. What am I looking at?"**

Welcome to the **Magick Programming Language (MPL)**. If you are confused, you are in the right place. Below are the answers to the questions you are likely asking yourself right now.

## 🔮 The Basics

### Q: Is this a game? A generic RPG system?
**A:** No. MPL is a fully functional, interpreted **Domain Specific Language (DSL)** running on Python.
While it uses the terminology of magic ("invoke", "cast", "mana"), it executes real computational logic. It is an experiment in **Technomancy**—treating code as a ritual and algorithms as spells.

### Q: So... is it "real" magic?
**A:** That depends on your definition.
* **If you mean Harry Potter:** No, sparks won't fly out of your monitor.
* **If you mean Crowley/Agrippa:** Yes. Magic is often defined as *"The Science and Art of causing Change to occur in conformity with Will."*
    Writing code is the purest form of this definition. You type a command (Will), and the machine executes it (Change). MPL just makes this relationship explicit.

### Q: What is the goal of this project?
**A:** To bridge the gap between **Ancient Wisdom** (Hermeticism, Kabbalah, Shamanism) and **Modern Silicon**. We aim to prove that historical ritual structures (circles, invocations, banishings) are actually early forms of algorithms and memory management.

## ⚙️ The Mechanics (Under the Hood)

### Q: How does the "Ontology" work?
**A:** This is MPL's unique feature. Standard languages have "Standard Libraries" (Math, I/O). MPL has an **Ontological Database** (`data/magi_225.json`).
When you type `invoke.hermes()`, the interpreter doesn't just run a function. It queries the database for "Hermes Trismegistus," loads his attributes (Element: Air, Planet: Mercury, Speed: High), and injects those parameters into your runtime environment.

### Q: What is the "Tesla Protocol" (3-6-9)?
**A:** It is our flow-control logic. Instead of standard linear loops, MPL prioritizes execution based on Nikola Tesla's theories of resonance:
* **3 (Creation):** Initialization tasks (high priority).
* **6 (Sustenance):** Maintenance/Monitoring loops.
* **9 (Completion):** Garbage collection and process termination.
The engine physically structures memory allocation based on these triads.

### Q: Why Python? Why not C or Rust?
**A:** Python is the best language for rapid prototyping and has a rich ecosystem for data (JSON) and NLP (Natural Language Processing).
*Note: We plan to rewrite the core Runtime Engine (MRE) in Rust for version 1.0 to achieve "High-Frequency Rituals."*

## 🛡️ Ethics & Safety

### Q: Can I accidentally summon a demon with this?
**A:** In Computer Science, a "Daemon" is a background process that handles requests. So, yes, you can summon `solomonic.daemon` to listen to a port or run a cron job.
As for metaphysical entities? We claim no responsibility for what enters your life if you write a recursive loop without an exit condition.

### Q: Is this "Dark" or "Light" magic?
**A:** Code is neutral. It is a tool.
* You can use MPL to write a "Healing Script" that optimizes your file system (`Repair`).
* You can use it to write a "Hex" that spams a server (`Attack`).
* The Karma (and the `CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md`) is yours to manage.

## 🤝 Getting Involved

### Q: I don't know anything about magic. Can I contribute?
**A:** Absolutely. We need Python developers to help build the AST, Lexer, and Parser. Logic is logic.

### Q: I don't know how to code, but I know Occult History. Can I help?
**A:** Yes! Our "Ontology" (the database of 225 magicians) needs verified data. If you know the specific attributes of *Paracelsus* or *Baba Yaga*, please submit a Pull Request to update the JSON files.

### Q: Where do I start?
**A:**
1.  Read the [Manifesto](../MANIFESTO.md).
2.  Check the [Roadmap](ROADMAP.md).
3.  Look at the `examples/` folder to see what the syntax looks like.

# 🛡️ Code of Conduct: The Law of the Circle

## 1. Our Pledge

In the interest of fostering an open, welcoming, and enlightened environment, we as contributors and maintainers pledge to make participation in the **Magick Programming Language (MPL)** project a harassment-free experience for everyone.

We welcome all seekers regardless of age, body size, disability, ethnicity, sex characteristics, gender identity and expression, level of experience, education, socio-economic status, nationality, personal appearance, race, religion, or sexual identity and orientation.

**Our primary directive:** To build a bridge between technology and ancient wisdom with respect, curiosity, and integrity.

## 2. Our Standards

To maintain the sanctity of this repository, we expect all participants to adhere to the following behaviors:

### ✅ Expected Behavior (The Right Hand Path)
* **Respect for Lineages:** This project aggregates knowledge from diverse traditions (Hermeticism, Sufism, Kabbalah, Shamanism, Taoism, etc.). Treat every tradition and its figures with dignity. Academic critique is welcome; disrespect is not.
* **Constructive Feedback:** Provide criticism that helps the code (and the practitioner) grow. Focus on the logic, not the person.
* **Empathy:** Attempt to understand differing perspectives. We are a global community of developers and researchers.
* **Using Welcoming Language:** Be inclusive. We are building a universal language.

### ❌ Unacceptable Behavior (The Left Hand Path)
* **Religious or Spiritual Intolerance:** Derogatory comments about any specific belief system, ritual practice, or historical figure will not be tolerated.
* **Harassment:** Public or private harassment, trolling, or insulting/derogatory comments.
* **Doxxing:** Publishing others' private information, such as a physical or electronic address, without explicit permission.
* **Malicious Intent:** Submitting code designed to harm, exploit, or create backdoors (No "Maleficium").

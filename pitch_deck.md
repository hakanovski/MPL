# 🚀 MPL: The Pitch

**Project:** Magick Programming Language (MPL)
**Tagline:** Code is the modern spellbook. We just forgot the syntax.
**Status:** Pre-Alpha (v0.1.0)

## 1. The Problem: The Disenchantment of Software

We live in a world governed by code. Algorithms determine what we see, how we travel, and who we meet. Yet, the act of programming has become purely utilitarian—sterile, mechanical, and devoid of meaning.

* **Code is powerful, but soulless:** We write logic, but we ignore *intent*.
* **History is forgotten:** We treat "daemons," "orphans," and "wizards" as empty technical jargon, forgetting their roots in ancient philosophy.
* **The gap is widening:** There is no bridge between the **Mystic** (who understands intent and consciousness) and the **Engineer** (who understands syntax and logic).

## 2. The Solution: Re-Enchanting the Machine

**MPL (Magick Programming Language)** is an interpreted Domain Specific Language (DSL) that restores the link between metaphysical intent and computational execution.

It is a fully functional programming language where:
* **Variables** are *Vessels* that hold energy.
* **Functions** are *Rituals* that transform state.
* **Loops** are *Cycles* governed by the Tesla Protocol (3-6-9).
* **Libraries** are *Grimoires* of historical knowledge.

We are not building a game. We are building a **Syntax for Reality**.

## 3. How It Works (The Tech Stack)

MPL runs on a custom **Magic Runtime Engine (MRE)** built in Python 3.8+.

1.  **Ontology-Driven:** Unlike Python or C++, MPL doesn't just run math. It queries a proprietary database of **225 Historical Magicians** (`data/magi_225.json`). When you `invoke.hermes()`, the system actually loads attributes related to communication and speed into the memory stack.
2.  **The Tesla Protocol:** A unique event-loop architecture that prioritizes processes based on harmonic resonance (3, 6, 9) rather than simple linear queues.
3.  **Technomancy Ready:** Designed to interface with IoT APIs. A "Lighting Ritual" in MPL doesn't just print text; it talks to the Philips Hue API to physically change the color of your room.

## 4. Market & Audience (Who is this for?)

We are targeting the intersection of three distinct but overlapping communities:

* **Creative Coders:** Artists using code (Processing, p5.js) who want a language with narrative depth.
* **The Esoteric Community:** Modern occultists, chaos magicians, and researchers looking to modernize their practice.
* **Educators & Historians:** Using the language to teach the history of science and philosophy (e.g., "Learn Alchemy by coding it").

## 5. Unique Value Proposition (Why MPL?)

| Feature | Standard Languages (Python/JS) | MPL (MagickScript) |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Logic** | Boolean (True/False) | Elemental (Fire/Water/Air/Earth) |
| **Flow Control** | Linear `for` loops | Harmonic `cycle(3-6-9)` |
| **Data Source** | Empty / User Input | Historical Ontology (Pre-loaded knowledge) |
| **Goal** | Efficiency | Resonance & Intent |

## 6. Roadmap & Vision

* **Phase 1: The Awakening (Now)**
    * Core Interpreter and Grammar defined.
    * 225 Magician Ontology structured.
* **Phase 2: The Engine (Q2 2026)**
    * Functional "Tesla Coil" loop logic.
    * Standard Library (Alchemy & Solomonic modules).
* **Phase 3: The Manifestation (2027)**
    * **Hardware integration:** MPL running on Raspberry Pi to control physical altars/smart homes.
    * **AI Synthesis:** Integrating LLMs to interpret "Sigils" (ASCII art) as executable code.

## 7. The Ask

We are looking for:
* **Python Developers** to help build the AST and Parser.
* **Occult Researchers** to verify the historical accuracy of the Ontology.
* **Visionaries** to join the Circle.
